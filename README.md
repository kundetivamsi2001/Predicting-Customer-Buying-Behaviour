# Predicting-Customer-Buying-Behaviour
This is a Predicting Customer Behaviour Project which is build on the British Airways customer booking Dataset 
the dataset consists of the folling fields.
This is flight booking data of British Airways over the last few years.
The attribute descriptions as follows:

**num_passengers** = number of passengers travelling

**sales_channel** = sales channel booking was made on

**trip_type** = trip Type (Round Trip, One Way, Circle Trip)

**purchase_lead** = number of days between travel date and booking date

**length_of_stay** = number of days spent at destination

**flight_hour** = hour of flight departure

**flight_day** = day of week of flight departure

**route** = origin -> destination flight route

**booking_origin** = country from where booking was made

**wants_extra_baggage** = if the customer wanted extra baggage in the booking

**wants_preferred_seat** = if the customer wanted a preferred seat in the booking

**wants_in_flight_meals** = if the customer wanted in-flight meals in the booking

**flight_duration** = total duration of flight (in hours)

**booking_complete** = flag indicating if the customer completed the booking

CONCLUSION:

#observation -1

->We can  say that there are 50000 records in the dataset.i.e 50000 customer data is available.

->On an average the duration of the flight journey is around 7.2 hours.

->On an average the passengers are booking their tickets 84 days before,their travel date.

->We can say  that the average number of days that the passenger spent at destination is around 23 days.
